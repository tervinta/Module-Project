# Bootcamp: Horiseon Website Refactor

## Description 
The Horiseon website is created to advertise its services. Horiseon's main goal is to assist other companies in enhancing their online visibility. They provide services such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing, all of which increase brand recognition while reducing labor and costs.

The website's primary purpose is to provide information. Vibrant images are used to capture the attention of visitors. Large headings and succinct text are used to convey information simply and effectively. The navigation bar contains links that can be clicked to navigate to specific sections, adding some interactivity. The CSS is bright, colorful, and easy to read. Alt tags have also been added to make the website accessible to everyone.

In the future, I would like to address some of the overflow issues that occur when the screen is minimized within the main sections and the navigation bar. I encountered difficulties with this and hope to overcome them. Additionally, in order to make this website more successful for Horiseon, I believe it would be important to include contact information within the same index.html or on a separate page.
